# Blockchain-Simulator

This is a simple blockchain simulator that demonstrates how a blockchain works. It starts with a "genesis block," which is the first block in the blockchain. After that, users can add new blocks to the blockchain by mining them. The simulator also checks if the blockchain is valid by verifying that each blockâ€™s previous hash matches.

The simulator is built entirely in Python. FastAPI is used to make the simulator interactive and easy to understand.
